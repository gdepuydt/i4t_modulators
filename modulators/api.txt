API specs:
-be able to create modulators of a certain type directly. eg. Wave(), BitShifter();
-Be able to add these modulators to a unique environment/container.
    an environment is at it's core a hashmap of different modulators.
    the function for adding a modulator to an  environment (existing or new) is as follows:
        void add_modulator(const char *name, Modulator *mod);

        First, this method will look if there's already an environment with that name.
        If such environment already exists, cif the modulator is already in that environment, do nothing.
        otherwise  add the modulator reference to the environment
        If no environment exists with that name, a new environment is created and the modulator is added to the new environment

        Note that the environment is itself part of a hashmap

        environment_map -> hashmap of environments

        environment -> hashmap  of modulators
        there can be more than one environment, all with a unique key.
        There can however be only one environment_map (so this datastructure should be hidden from the user)
